## Description
SymPhoneic is an Android app intended to be used by musicians looking for suggestions for scales and chord progressions to use in their compositions or arrangements. It uses the phone's microphone to detect a pitch, which the user can save to memory. After saving one to three pitches, the user can proceed to a second screen with recommendations for scales and chord progressions, and can mark chord progressions as "favorites" to browse later.
